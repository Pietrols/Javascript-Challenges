# Javascript-Challenges

This repo contains a lot of challenges designed to help master varous JavaScript concepts and methods.

## How It Works

- Each challenge lives in its own file under `/js`.
- You can run them individually in the browser or Node.js.
- Sample inputs and expected outputs are included in each file.

- All the projects are contained in the src file.
- To run the project, simply open the template.html file and add the particular .js file extension to the script, and run on your browser (open your console), or run on node.
- This focuses on Javascript, therefore, little to no styling is included.
